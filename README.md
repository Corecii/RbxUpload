# RbxUpload

RbxUpload is a tool to upload assets to Roblox.

On Windows, RbxUpload can retrieve your Roblox Studio cookie automatically so you do not have to provide login details or a cookie. Alternatively, you can set the `ROBLOX_COOKIE` environment variable. RbxUpload does not provide a mechanism for logging in and does not permit passwords or cookies in the command line arguments.
